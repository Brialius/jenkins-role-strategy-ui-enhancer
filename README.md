# Jenkins Role Strategy UI enhancer

##Context

The [Role Strategy Plugin allows](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Role+Strategy+Plugin) to Jenkins Adminsitrator to handle users' 
permissions with a role based mecahism.

The plugin's UI was not initial design to support a large set of users/roles. As 
detailled in this [Jenkins Jira ticket](), the role assignation can be quickly a nightmare.

Since there is no scheduled released of this plugins for the coming months, I 
searched a temporal workaround.

##Solution

Basically, I searched a way to display the table cell coordinates (column/row headers)
in a tooltip when the user's mouse will be hover a that cell. 

Greasemonkey is a well-known Firefox/Chrome extension which permits to develop
Javascript to customize the Web pages behaviors.

So, I developed the jenkins-role-strategy-ui-enhancer.js script to enhance the
Role Strategy's UI.
